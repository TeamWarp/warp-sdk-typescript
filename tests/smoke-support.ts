// File generated from our OpenAPI spec by Scalar. See README.md for details.

// Shared by every smoke test under `tests/api-resources/`. Each test calls one SDK method the way
// the SDK exposes it, against the server named by TEST_API_BASE_URL:
//
//   TEST_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4010 npm test
//
// Environment variables:
//   - TEST_API_BASE_URL: the server to call. Unset, every smoke test skips, so a plain `npm test`
//     never calls the real API. Credentials come from the variables the client itself reads.
//   - SCALAR_SMOKE_FILTER: comma-separated needles; only cases whose operation name or path
//     contains one of them run. Empty means no filter.
//   - SCALAR_SMOKE_REPORT_DIR: a directory; each test process appends one JSON line per case it
//     ran to its own file there. The generator uses this to collect per-case results.
//
// Regeneration does not yet delete a test file whose resource was renamed or removed. Delete a
// stale file under `tests/api-resources/` by hand, or `npm test` keeps running it.
